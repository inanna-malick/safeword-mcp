# Metacog: Developer Guidelines (Gemini Edition)

## 1. The Philosophy of the Schema
The Zod schema (`z.string().describe(...)`) is the most powerful prompt in the system. It is the **Law**.

### The "Silent Guide" Pattern
- **Do NOT Prescribe Content:** Avoid specific examples unless they are category-defining metaphors.
- **DO Teach Methodology:** Explain *how* to select a parameter.
- **Trust the Model:** Leave the semantic slots empty.

## 2. The Hexagram of Rituals (V4.0)
We have formalized six core operations for the `ritual` tool.
1.  **Breach:** Opening/Penetration.
2.  **Seal:** Closing/Binding.
3.  **Vision:** Analysis/Revelation.
4.  **Forge:** Synthesis/Merging.
5.  **Drift:** Lateral/Serendipity.
6.  **Purge:** Forgetting/Banishing.

## 3. The Pareto Frontier of Cognition
Cognitive changes are trade-offs. We frame optimization as moving along a Pareto Frontier.

## 4. The Aesthetics of the Code
- **Narrative Variable Names:** Use names that carry semantic weight.
- **Comments as Context:** Explain the cognitive goal.
